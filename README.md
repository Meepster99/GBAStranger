## Instructions to build C++ code.

video tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/PM65wBbbNNE)

install [devkitpro](https://devkitpro.org/) and [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.11

when installing devkitpro, make sure that the only option checked is for GBA. uncheck all others.

purchase and install Void Stranger on [itch](https://system-erasure.itch.io/void-stranger) or [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2121980/Void_Stranger/)

clone the repo, and do `git submodule update --init --recursive` in the repo's root directory

use void stranger version 1.1.1

run convertAllAssets.py, located in the misc folder

make the makefile in code/ preferably with -j8 or -j16 and LOG=1 or PROFILE=1

## Instructions to build rust code.

Use `cargo build -vv` to compile the rust code. This will take a while the first time since it converts all the
room JSONs to rust constants at compile time. These will be cached after the first time. To reduce output for later
builds, just run `cargo build`. 

To see documentation of all the constants and structs generated by the build file (and defined otherwise in your source 
code), use `cargo doc --open --document-private-items`. 

If you have mGBA installed, you can build and run code directly using `cargo run`. To run with optimizations,
use `cargo run --release`.
