ok, so 
i need to latch lines 0-15, 16-23 are ok bc those arent used for data.

CS low latches 0-15
RD low(i think?) reads 16 bits(unsigned short/short)

each sequential RD low increases the address, for sequential reads.

address inc occurs on the rising edge of RD 

i despise doing any sort of tristate logic, im going to despise this 

wait states, going to be an issue.

additionally, i should be able to do a write to rom to trigger a bank swap.

for save data, use FRAM, no battery, no expiration(of said batter), no running out like flash 


TODO:
CS2, what is it 
WR 
CLK, needed? 
the cart irq, might be very useful. 

i could maybe use it to stop all other, stuff from occuring (including music?) 
when swapping the rom banks 
and i could literally do a read from ROM inside the cart irq to see if the cartridge 
was actually removed(trigger add scene) or just a swap, and continue as normal 

aligning the music data, may also be an issue.

i also despise using a fpga/cpld for something as simple as this, but regretably, thats 
just the way of the world 
i feel like that type of design ruined the beauty of so many older devices.
everythings just one chip these days

cheap, available, yea. this will work well.
except, the voltage? i need 3.3
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/210257/max-v-5m80z-cpld/specifications.html 
says it works with variable input voltages, but other sites,,, ugh 

actually, doesnt seem ill be able to use this 
needs a 1.8V vcc, even if i can have the io go to 3.3, the extra hardware to drop 3.3 to 1.8 aint worth it
